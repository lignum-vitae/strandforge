# StrandForge

**StrandForge** is a Survival-RPG game set in a world where your greatest weapon—and vulnerability—is your own genome. Armed with a tool called the **BioLink**, you don’t just adapt to survive. You *evolve*.

### 🧬 Core Concept

> **Your body is your build. Your genome is your gear.**

In StrandForge, your character's biology is fully editable. You’ll explore a living world, scan its inhabitants, analyze their genetic traits, and **forge your evolution** through a powerful genome editor powered by the in-game system called **BioLink**.


## Gameplay Loop

### Scan

Explore a richly biodiverse world and encounter creatures with unique abilities. Use your BioLink to scan their genetic traits.

> *You spot a silent jungle cat. Scanning reveals an elastin-rich muscle protein responsible for silent, flexible movement.*


### Analyze

Your BioLink breaks down the DNA sequence and returns a simplified analysis.

> `Sequence: GGA-CCT-TTG`  
> `Protein: High Glycine content`  
> `Trait: Enhanced muscle elasticity`


### Adapt

Store useful genetic sequences in your genome editor. Organize, study, and decide how to incorporate them into your body.


### Mutate

Modify your genome in one of three ways:

- **Replace**: Swap your gene with the new one (high risk, high reward)
- **Splice**: Merge it with your existing genome (moderate risk)
- **Simulate**: Preview changes using a virtual clone (low risk)

Each modification has potential side effects but also opens the path to incredible new traits.


## Evolving Identity

### Progression & Risk

- Build your **Complexity Pool** to manage more intricate edits over time.
- Traits influence physical form, resistance to environmental hazards (cold, radiation, toxins), and open new paths or abilities.
- Every decision leaves a biological mark—*you will change*.


### **Your Original Genome**
Every player begins StrandForge with a **starting genome**—a baseline that represents their human origin. As the game progresses, every modification you make becomes part of your **evolutionary history**.

- Track how much of your genome has changed over time.
- Access earlier "genomic snapshots" via BioLink, allowing partial or full rollbacks.
- Choose whether to embrace full transformation or preserve pieces of your humanity.

> _How much change is too much? Can you evolve without losing yourself?_

### ⚠️ **Genetic Dependencies & Mutation Risks**

Not all traits play nicely together. The genome is a complex system, and careless editing has consequences.

- **Synergy Required**: Certain traits require **co-expression** to work correctly.  
  E.g., gaining an **Enhanced Cold Resistance** without deactivating your **High-Oxygen Blood** may cause cognitive instability or limit mobility, reducing stamina or attack.
  Antifreeze proteins interact best with iron-based hemoglobin. Hemocyanin-based systems are copper-based and chemically incompatible with hemoglobin-supporting antifreeze mechanisms.

- **Negative Mutations**: Improper gene configurations can:
  - Trigger metabolic disorders
  - Cause cognitive instability
  - Shorten lifespan or limit mobility

Players must **study**, **simulate**, and **balance** their edits carefully—or pay the price.

## Goal of the Game

While survival is the short-term focus, the long-term goal of StrandForge is evolution itself.

### Endgame Ideas
- Become a **perfected post-human**—a synthesis of biology and purpose.
- Defeat a final apex predator or **boss organism** that threatens the world’s genetic future.
- Explore the **Vaults**, ancient repositories of extinct DNA, to ascend to a new biological plane.

> _Is evolution the end—or just the beginning?_


## BioLink System

StrandForge’s biological systems are driven by **BioLink**, a simplified but scientifically inspired engine that maps:

- DNA sequences → proteins
- Proteins → physical traits
- Trait interactions → gameplay consequences

Think of it as your in-game biologist, helping translate complex life science into augmentable traits.


## 🧗 What Makes StrandForge Unique?

- **Editable genome as a game mechanic**
- **Survival RPG meets real-world-inspired evolution**
- **Visualized biology that impacts gameplay**
- **Semi-permanent, physical character transformation**


## 🚧 Status

> **Early Concept / Prototype Phase**  
Currently putting together the building blocks for this project.
